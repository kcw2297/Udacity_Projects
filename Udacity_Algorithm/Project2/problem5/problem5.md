### A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list. Each block contains some information and how it is connected related to the other blocks in the chain

### Explanation : This problem is similar to a linked list

##### time complexity : O(1), Insert element E at current point
##### space complexity : O(n),  the number of block is depend on input size
