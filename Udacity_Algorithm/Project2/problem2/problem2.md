## Finding Files
### For this problem, the goal is to write code for finding all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with ".c"

### Explanation : I used recursion because each files has different depth

##### time complexity : O(n), the number of loop depends on number of path of files
##### space complexity : O(n), the number of allocated variable depends on files
