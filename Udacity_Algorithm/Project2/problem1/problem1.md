## Least Recently Used Cache
### An LRU cache is a type of cache in which we remove the least recently used entry when the cache memory reaches its limit.

### Explanation : I used hash map function to make all operation O(1)


##### time complexity : O(1), because it returns value base on key.
##### space complexity : O(n), because number of linked-lists are based on number of entries or input
