# Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
### n this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code should run in O(n) time.

### Work Flow : Compare all the elements in the list

#### Time Complexity : O(n), It loops all the elements once
#### Space Complexity : O(1), single traverse
